# Playstore-Apps-Analysis-and-Visualization
This project aims on cleaning the dataset, analyze the given dataset, and mining informational quality insights. This project also involves visualizing the data to better and easily understand trends and different categories.

# Project Description
This project will help you understand how a real-world database is analyzed
using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset,
pre-process the data using python for a better upcoming performance, how a
structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the
database, and visualize the data with the power bi tool.
The Project will consist of 2 modules:
Module 1: Pre-processing, Analyzing data using Python and SQL.
Module 2: Visualizing data using Power bi.

# Tools and Technologies
1. SQL (SSMS)
2. POWER BI

# Module 1
In this module, you will query the dataset using structured query
language to gain insights from the database. The problem statements to
be solved will be provided to you and you need to provide the solution
for the same using your logic. Different concepts of SQL will be used in
this process such as aggregating the data, grouping the data, ordering
the data, etc.

# Module 2
In this module, you will be using both datasets for visualizing what the
numbers in and behind the data want to convey. You have to create a
dashboard for the same using different statistical graphs and diagrams
for a visual understanding and analysis.
